we used the spotify api to sequentially request all songs in my spotify library.
rates are limited to 50 songs per request
the algorithm works like this:
request_songs(50 songs from index 0)
request_songs(50 songs from index 51) etc
then we collect artist information
then we use the artist information to find related artists 
then we create a graph using those relations


Goals: 
1. make a pretty graph(has to be colorful)
2. 
  a. create a set of statistics which can be calculated for 1 year 
    i. song count
    ii. artist count
    iii. unique languages
    iv. songs per language
    v. genres(the gross way)
    vi. genres(a more interesting way)
  b. figure out artist frequency
  c. see if i can make predictions about 2021-2024
